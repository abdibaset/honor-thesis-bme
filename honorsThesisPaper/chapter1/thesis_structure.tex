This thesis is divided into two main projects. The first is part of a larger project aimed at developing an mPAI 
framework for simultaneously quantifying multiple immune checkpoint receptors, including PD1, PDL1, and CD80. 
My contribution focuses specifically on diffusion experiments to determine the diffusion coefficients and times. 
These diffusion times are critical for establishing appropriate incubation durations in tissue mimicking phantoms 
inoculated with tumor cells, ensuring reliable agent distribution prior to imaging. A comprehensive account of these 
diffusion studies, along with the associated experimental protocols, is presented in Chapter 2.

The second project involves a PAI approach using soluble PD1 to quantify the fraction of PDL1 receptors that are 
functionally available for PD1 binding. A detailed account of this work is provided in Chapter 4. The general structure of 
the thesis is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter 2:Antibody and soluble protein diffusion coefficients - Description of tissue mimicking 
    phantom use for determining diffusion parameters.
    \item Chapter 3: Selection of fluorophore combinations using liquid phantoms - Identification of spectrally 
    compatible dyes and assessment of signal interference.
    \item Chapter 4: PAI:  Quantification of functionally available PDL1 for PD1 binding.
    \item Chapter 5: Future work and global conclusions.
\end{itemize}
