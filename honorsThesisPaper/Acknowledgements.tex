I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Kimberley Samkoe and Dr. Divya Ravi for their invaluable mentorship and steadfast support, which have been instrumental since my freshman summer. As my academic advisor and research mentor, Dr. Samkoe—an Associate Professor at Dartmouth College and the Principal Investigator of the Samkoe Laboratory—introduced me to research and provided the foundational opportunity to join her lab. I am also deeply indebted to Dr. Divya Ravi, a recent graduate of the Molecular and Cellular Biology program at the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies, whose exceptional patience and dedication in training me - while simultaneously completing her dissertation - greatly contributed to my development as a research assistant. I also extend my thanks to the entire Samkoe Laboratory, especially Sassan Hodge, Veronica Torres, and Sanjana Pannem, for their collaborative spirit and consistent support in experimental design and data analysis.

This work was generously supported in part by summer internship funding from the E.E. Just Program and by a research funding award from the Dartmouth Cancer Center’s Student Cancer Research in Immunology Projects (SCRIP), supported under grant number 5P30CA023108-45.
